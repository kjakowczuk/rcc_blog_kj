Welcome to my website!! Here, I will be showing off my R portfolio.

I created this website as part of a course at Dominican University. It was created with R and Quarto in RStudio.

Special shout out to Dr. Bob for this awesome summer crash course opportunity.

Special thanks to the CrumpLab which made the template for this website available in github: <https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog>
